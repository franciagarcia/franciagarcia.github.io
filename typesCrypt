                <h2>Symmetric key cryptography</h2>
                <p>
                    The key is use both for encryption and decryption. Therefore is not very same to use.
                    
                    Examples:  
                        1. Data Encryption System(DES):
                            DES is a block cipher that has 56 bits key length. 
                            It encrypts data in 64-bits segments(of plaintext) at a time.
                        2. Advanced Encryption System(AES):
                            This a block cipher and key size can be size of 128, 192, or 256 bits.
                            Encyption is done by a series of operations that are linked together.

                <p>
                    uses pair: public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt. The way it works:
                        1. the sender uses the recipientâ€™s public key to encrypt the data.
                        2.The recipient then uses their private key to decrypt the data
                    Advantages
                        1.eliminates the need to exchange secret
                        2. allows for the creation of digital signatures
                            a.which can be used to verify the authenticity of data
                    examples:
                       Algorithms: RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

                    There is no key in this algorithm instead it has a hash value of fixed length.
